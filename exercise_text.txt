Patient is a pleasant 53-year-old woman now here for a consultation. Well developed, well-nourished patient. No acute distress.
Patient appears stated age. No purpura. No No petechiae. Normocephalic. Sclerae are anicteric. Conjunctivae and lids are normal in appearance.

Patient's lab results were returned and are as noted: ALK/ROS1 (-), EGFR/BRAF not noted, PD-L1-80%.  Patient had some concerns about her labs
but I discussed the results in detail. Her lab results are not a matter of concern as of now.

A CT scan of the patient's chest indicated a mass producing a narrowing of the bronchus.  These imaging results were discussed
with the patient.  We discussed further treatment options.
